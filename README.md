# MERPG

The MERPG-game, whose design documents (all written in finnish) and some pretty pictures exist in [merpg.webs.com](http://merpg.webs.com). I also [blog](http://yearofourlord.blogspot.com) about this project. Of course, remember to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/feuer__)

I recently spent a huge amount of time procrastinating on removing the old ~ten atoms littered around the various namespaces - approach to state handling from this codebase. Now that the state lives in a single atom I can asynchronously mold with [Reagi](https://github.com/weavejester/reagi) and [core.async](https://github.com/clojure/core.async), it should be easier to further develop this project. Or at least it should be easier to make a treelist representation of a game project's DOM now that finding the children of an object isn't a anymore comparable to finding the largest prime in existence.

## Usage

Currently under-development, thus there's no way to actually use it :)

## Namespaces
* merpg.immutable has been removed
* merpg.2D.animation contains the Swing/Java2D-wrapper I [wrote](http://yearofourlord.blogspot.fi/2013/11/planning-for-merpg-2d-library.html) last December.

## License

Distributed currently under the GPLv3, because I don't care enough to research something better. Will probably change though.

## Assets

At the moment I use test assets drawn by [fairandcruel](http://fairandcruel.tumblr.com) and [rinkamari](http://rinkamari.tumblr.com) with all rights granted for this project. Here's a list of the assets I also use that haven't been drawn by previously mentioned:
