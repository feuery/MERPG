# MERPG

The MERPG-game, whose design documents (all written in finnish) and some pretty pictures exist in [merpg.webs.com](http://merpg.webs.com). I also [blog](http://yearofourlord.blogspot.com) about this project. Of course, remember to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Feuer_himbeere).

## Usage

Currently under-development, thus there's no way to actually use it :)

## Namespaces
* merpg.immutable mustn't contain any side-effecting functions
* merpg.2D.animation will contain the Swing/Java2D-wrapper I [wrote](http://yearofourlord.blogspot.fi/2013/11/planning-for-merpg-2d-library.html) last December.

## License

Distributed currently under the GPLv3, because I don't care enough to research something better. Will probably change though.
